# Read-me

- The csv files are in the parking-citations-2018 files folder.
- It's a big file. Download both part 1 and part 2 and extract it.
- Open your anaconda, google colab or any other program editing tool. 
- Open the ipynb file
- Depending where you extract the csv file change the path variable located under the title Clean Data - Null Values
- Right click on the csv file
- Click on properties and next to Location, copy the directory. Ex: '\Users\Dustin\Desktop...\parking-citations-2018.csv'
- Then paste it to the path variable. Remember it needs to have '' in between it.
- If \ doesn't work. Replace \ with / 

For those who want to dig in even deeper!
- Feel free to play revise or play around with the code.
- You can download the whole data located in the folder all data. The csv file contains more years.
- Or from the kaggle website https://www.kaggle.com/cityofLA/los-angeles-parking-citations. You will need an account to download
